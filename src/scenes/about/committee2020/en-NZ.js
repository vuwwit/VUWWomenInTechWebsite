  PRESIDENT_About:
      "Hey all, I'm Angitha. This is my third year as a VUWWIT exec and my first year as President. So far we've been lucky enough to avoid cancelling any planned events and I'm hoping it stays that way cause I'm excited for everyone to get amongst our events, make some new friends and meet some employers. Other than VUWWIT, during this lockdown I've been working at Countdown, Netflixing, going on small hikes/walks and have been dabbling in some woodworking too.",

  SECRETARY_About:
      "Hi I'm Lavanya, the Secretary this year ðŸ˜Š I'm a 4th year SWEN student and I'm loving this lockdown. What I've been doing every day is a mixture of uni work, youtube/netflix binges, testing out new recipes and playing with my new puppy. After lockdown, I'm looking forward to going to cafe's and meeting my friends in person since most of them are already working so I never see them at uni anyway.",

      "As soon as the lockdown was announced my flat mates and I made the decision to stay here at our flat in Wellington. Weâ€™ve been busy with working from home, uni assignments and taking breaks to play PS4 and binge watch shows. Weâ€™re also taking turns to host themed dinner parties from Japanese night with ramen and Studio Ghibli movies to our Easter dinner on Good Friday. Itâ€™s always fun getting dressed up and not wearing our PJs 24/7 ðŸ˜Š\n" +

      "Hey hey hey! ðŸ‘‹Nice to meet ya, I'm Melina- the Media Liaison for VUWWIT 2020! I've been quite lucky to join VUWWIT this year, and I hope to successfully engage you digitally with all with the exciting things we have coming up and boost the awesome opportunities that VUWWIT will be offering diverse people like m'self! I'm in my last year of study, finishing off with a degree in Computer Science topped off with some sweet Cyber Security- but for the last 4 weeks (probably longer) I've been absolutely thriving at home with all the arts and crafts you can imagine, baking random stuff, making tunes, Mortal Kombat, Sid Meier's Civ, The Sims, gardening(???!), and a coupla unsolicited flat dance parties. Kind of sad it's almost over, but I'm totally excited to see some faces that aren't exclusively my flatmates. ðŸ¤ªEnjoy these last few weeks- the world isn't going to be put on hold like this again! (I hope) ðŸ™ƒ",

  Campaigns_Liaison_About:
      "Hi everyone- I am Sanjana and I am the Campaigns Liaison for VUWWIT. With how this year has turned to be, we are all stuck somewhere; I am on lockdown inside my family house in Wellington with my parents, my younger brother and my cute dog. So in the past 2 weeks of lockdown, I have been working from home 2 days a week, I have explored some bush walks in my area, watched a few too many series from Netflix, and most of all spending time with my family playing board games and making the most out of this lockdown. I hope all of you stay inside, not too long to go!",

    Outreach_Officer_About:
      "Hi, my name is Sam. I'm a second year engineering student majoring in Cybersecurity. I'm the Outreach Officer this year, and will be organising events like Tech Day for Girls. Being apart of VUWWIT is a great opportunity to connect with younger students interested in STEM related subjects as well as get to know more engineering students at Vic. During the lockdown I've been hanging out with my family, skyping friends and enjoying lots of extra sleep-ins. I've been experimenting with some baking - even if it was just a box chocolate cake. I've also been working on my photography - using my favorite op-shop film camera. It's nice to just take a break and slow down for a while.\n" +
      "Hope everyone is coping with the lockdown and look forward to seeing you all back at uni very soon!",

      "I am in my 3rd year of an Electronics and Computer Systems Engineering degree, and I think itâ€™s pretty fantastic that we have a Women In Tech club to support and grow diversity in STEM fields! I canâ€™t wait to put on some cooool workshops to help STEM folks learn, make friends and eat some tasty food - when itâ€™s safe to gather again that is! To pass time during lockdown Iâ€™ve been picking up some new hobbies. Iâ€™ve started playing Transformice online with friends, and when my mouse BounceBounce dies virtually I yell even louder than my electric whisk making Dalgona coffee in the morning. Iâ€™ve also been learning to juggle, and this is very very fun - when Iâ€™m not throwing the balls onto my faceâ€¦",
