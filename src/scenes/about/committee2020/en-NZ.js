I’m a 4th year conjoint student, studying a Bachelor of Science (Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence) and Bachelor of Commerce (Management & Information Systems) - that’s quite a mouthful! When I’m not doing back-to-back assignments, I love playing and watching sports, singing, travel, playing with makeup, and having a wine or three.",
  I_JOINED_THE_COMMITTEE:
      "I joined the Committee because I wanted to join a group like VUWWIT when I started at VUW, and it didn’t exist. As a Māori-Asian woman, diversity means a lot to me, and it’s so important that people feel supported and safe to continue learning and doing what they love. The tech industry needs diverse perspectives, experiences, and ideas, and I want to do my bit to ensure it grows in the right way.”",
